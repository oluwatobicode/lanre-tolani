        Hi baby, this is to thank you for being so amazing throughout the
        year❤️. The crazy thing is there are so many things to thank you for so
        I don’t even know where to start from but I guess I’ll start from how I
        was so serious with my plan of not entering any other relationship this
        year till 2025 not until I met you, like I usually say that you used
        jazz for me but for real you won me over with your gentle love. I love
        how you’re so gentle with me, so kind and so caring about anything that
        concerns me. You’re literally the biggest highlight of my 2024 which
        makes me so thankful I went out that night we met cos I don’t even know
        how my year would have been without you in it.
      </p>
